# 3D printed case

The design files for the 3D printed case of Tanmatsu can be found on [Github](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/tanmatsu-mechanical/) and may be used under terms of the CERN-OHL-P license.

## Filament

The 3D printed case and spacer included with Tanmatsu was printed using Extrudr XPETG filament on Prusa Mini printers.

## Design files

The design is available as a FreeCAD project. If you are looking for files ready to 3D print you can find those in the [releases section of the repository](https://github.com/Nicolai-Electronics/tanmatsu-mechanical/releases). Please note that early units (revision 1 and 2 boards) have the audio jack located in a slightly different location compared to the production version of the mainboard. Variants for the revision 1 and 2 boards are available as separate models.

## Special thanks

We want to thank [Jelle Haandrikman](https://github.com/jhaand) for recreating fhe design in FreeCAD, allowing everyone to edit the design with ease using a FOSS toolchain as well as our friends over at [YTec 3D](https://ytec3d.com/) for developing the Tanmatsu case and designs. Check out their amazing projects.
